        <h2>Modern Era</h2>
	<hr size=5 color='blue'>
        <p>On 30 July 2013, the Congress Working Committee unanimously passed a resolution to recommend the formation of a separate Telangana state. After various stages the bill was placed in the Parliament of India in February 2014. In February 2014, Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014 bill was passed by the Parliament of India for the formation of Telangana state comprising ten districts from north-western Andhra Pradesh. The bill received the assent of the President on 1 March 2014.</p>
	<p>The state of Telangana was officially formed on 2 June 2014. Kalvakuntla Chandrashekar Rao was elected as the first chief minister of Telangana, following elections in which the Telangana Rashtra Samithi party secured majority. Hyderabad will remain as the joint capital of both Telangana and Andhra Pradesh for a period, not more than 10 years.</p>

	<h2>Telangana Movement</h2>

	<img style="width:256px;float:right;margin:0px0px" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/62/Andhra_Pradesh_and_Telangana.png/800px-Andhra_Pradesh_and_Telangana.png">
	<p style="margin-right: 280px;">The Telangana movement was a political movement in India that aimed to create a separate state of Telangana from the pre-existing state of Andhra Pradesh. The movement began in the 1960s and gained momentum in the 2000s, with several protests and agitations taking place. Supporters of the movement cited discrimination in government jobs, education, and public spending as some of the reasons for their demand for a separate state.</p>
	<p style="margin-right: 280px;">The movement was rooted in the historical, economic, social, and cultural identity of Telangana. Proponents of the movement argued that Telangana had a distinct identity and history that was being ignored and oppressed by the larger state of Andhra Pradesh. They also argued that a separate state of Telangana would lead to better governance and development, as resources would be more focused on the needs of the region.</p>
	<p style="margin-right: 280px;">Telangana has also witnessed significant political developments in recent times. The Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) led by K. Chandrashekar Rao has been the dominant political force in the state since its formation. The party has been successful in winning the assembly elections twice, in 2014 and 2018. The opposition parties, including the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), have been trying to make inroads in the state, but the TRS has maintained its hold on the state politics. Overall, the modern history of Telangana has been marked by significant changes and developments that have transformed the state into a growing hub of industry and commerce in South India.</p>
